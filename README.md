Hello everyone, I am an application used to protect the private videos and photos in mobile phone albums. It provides two independent encrypted album functions, the main and the auxiliary, to better ensure your privacy.

I am a localized application that can only interact with other mobile phone PAs or computer-side PAs in the same local area network, so there is no need to worry about data leakage.

With me, you can take some "special" photos or videos at will, don't worry about other people looking through your phone album, and cooperate with the computer-side PA to encrypt the backup to your computer.


My main functions include:
1. Main and sub-album: Contains two independent albums with the same function. Enter different passwords to enter different albums, so there is no need to worry about checking posts.
2. Basic album functions: folder creation, picture and video import/export/view, move, etc.
3. Transfer with computer: exchange video pictures with the computer PA in the same local area network, and encrypt the backup to the computer. The computer PA also has the function of an album.
4. Transfer with mobile phones: exchange video pictures with the mobile phone PA in the same local area network.
